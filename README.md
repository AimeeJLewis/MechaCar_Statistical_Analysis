### Statstical Analysis
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length and ground clearance are statitstially likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg value due to the fact that they both have a p-value with a significance level less than 0.05.
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?
Since we have a p-value of 5.35e-11 and we are taking our assumed significance level of 0.05%, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and that the slope of our linear model is zero.
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?
Since R-squared is .7149, that means that roughly 71% have a strong positive correlation between the variables.  We could say that this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Q. What metric or metrics are you going to test?
Q. What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
Q. What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
Q. What data is needed to run the statistical test?
